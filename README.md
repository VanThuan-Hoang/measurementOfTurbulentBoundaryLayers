# Measurement of turbulent boundary layers

This project was developed to measure flow velocities at a vertical distance of 0.15Â±0.03 mm from a flat plate.

A measurement is shown in the photo below:

# The equipment includes:
+ Dantect box (Using a hot-wire probe to measure flow velocities) and the Baratron (using a pitot static tube to measure flow velocities):

+ Traverse: It is used to place the hot-wire probe at a vertical position from the flat plate

# The code includes:
The .ino code moves the traverse with a command from a serial port. The command is sent from the Matlab codes.

The Matlab codes read the current location of the hot-wire probe with a laser displacement sensor. 

The Matlab codes control the traverse to place the probe vertically from the plate surface with feedback from the laser displacement sensor. 

The Matlab codes then read the velocities from the Dantec box.
